HATRED ALL THOSE YEARS ON EARTH NOT KNOWING NOT KNOWING BY THE TIME I 
REACHED THE CENTER OF THE DESIGN I REMEMBERED WHO I WAS AND I 
REMEMBERED MY PURPOSE I ALSO REMEMBERED THAT BY VIRTUE OF BEING AT 
THE CENTER OF THE DESIGN I COULD TRANSPORT MYSELF TO ANY PLACE IN THE 
UNIVERSE SIMPLY BY AN ACT OF WILL I SAW A FLEETING SHADE BUT IGNORED 
IT I CLOSED MY EYES AND WILLED MYSELF TO EMBER I STOOD IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE LIBRARY OF EMBER A STATELY ROOM WITH MANY MORE BOOKS THAN 
FLORIDAS LIBRARY HAD I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED SEVERAL DECKS IN A GLASS 
CASE NEAR THE FAR WALL I BROKE THE CASE AND TOOK ONE ON THE WALL 
ABOVE THE CASE HUNG A LONGSWORD I DREW IT OUT IT FELT LIGHT IN MY 
HAND I SWUNG IT ABOUT IN PRACTICE YES I KNEW HOW TO USE THE THING

BLAISE SIGHED AND TURNED AWAY BUT I CAN GET ONE I SAID RIGHT HE SAID 
QUIETLY I CAN OKAY YOU GET AN ARMY AND COME BACK I TURNED YOU MAY 
THINK THAT WE TREAT EACH OTHER CRUELLY BUT I MUST TELL YOU ONE THING 
THAT IS THE WAY OF OUR KIND I KNEW THAT I NEEDED AN ARMY IN ANY CASE 
SO I LEFT BLAISES CAMP TO TRAVEL THROUGH SHADE I NEEDED A LARGE FORCE 
PERHAPS A WHOLE WORLD AT MY FEET YES THAT WAS IT I WOULD SEEK OUT A 
SHADE IN WHICH I WAS A MESSIAH COME TO LEAD ITS INHABITANTS TO A HOLY 
WAR AGAINST EVIL I SET OUT AT ONCE I SHIFTED SHADES CHANGING THE 
ENVIRONMENT AS I WALKED ADDING FEATURES SUBTRACTING THEM A GREEN SKY 
A BLUE SUN NO THATS UGLY HOW ABOUT A PURPLE SUN NO NOT QUITE A RED 
SUN YES TREES GROWN HIGHER FORMING A CANOPY FAR ABOVE ME NO THAT RED 
SUN CLASHES WITH THE GREEN SKY SO I CHANGE THE SKY TO BLUE BETTER I 
AM THERE AT LAST I SAW A CITY OFF IN THE DISTANCE I BEGAN WALKING FOR 
IT HEY SCUMBAG SOMEONE SAID I WHIRLED A TALL THIN MAN REGARDED ME HIS 
HAIR WAS SPIKED IN THE CENTER OF HIS HEAD WHICH WAS HAIRLESS ON THE 
SIDES HE WORE A LONG GLITTERY EARRING ON HIS LEFT EAR HE WORE LEATHER 
ARMOR BUT SEEMED TO BE CARRYING NO WEAPONS WHY DOST THOU ACCOST ME SO 
I ASKED HE ONLY GLARED AT ME LOOK I SAID ISNT THIS A LAND WHICH HAS 
BEEN WAITING HUNDREDS OF YEARS FOR A MESSIAH TO DELIVER THEM NO THIS 
IS AN ANARCHOCOMMUNIST PUNK METROPOLIS YOU WANT THE NEXT SHADE OVER 
HE POINTED OH THANKS I SAID I STARTED OFF IN THAT DIRECTION HEY HE 
CALLED ARE YOU AN EMBERITE NO I YELLED BACK EMBERS ENEMIES IN SHADE 
ARE LEGION ANOTHER I CONCENTRATED ON MY DESTINATION AS I WALKED THE 
SHADES PASSED ME ON MY LEFT AND RIGHT I STOPPED THERE WAS A GROUP OF 
PEOPLE IN FRONT OF ME THEY WERE STANDING ON A STREETCORNER EIGHT OR 
NINE OF THEM I DREW MY SWORD AND STARTED TO SPEAK GREETINGS I THEY 
ALL POINTED TO THE WEST AND SAID IN UNISON NEXT SHADE OVER I SMILED 
WEAKLY THANKS I PUT MY SWORD BACK INTO ITS SCABBARD I WAS CLOSE AT 
LAST I CAME TO A WORLD WITH DEEP GREEN FORESTS AND WIDE GREEN PLAINS 
I STOOD ATOP A HILL AND ALL AROUND ME WERE HUDDLED THOUSANDS OF 
PATHETIC SHADE BEINGS EACH ONE LOOKED UP TO ME EAGERLY I AM CORBIN I 
YELLED THE MULTITUDE BURST INTO APPLAUSE THEY SCREAMED THEY BURNED 
THEIR HOMES THEY SACRIFICED VIRGINS I WAS THEIR GOD FOR MANY MONTHS I 
TRAINED THEM FOR THEIR MISSION THEY WERE EAGER TO LEAVE TO FIGHT THE 
EVIL ONE BUT I HAD TO ORGANIZE THEM FIRST AT LAST I HAD A FIGHTING 
FORCE I WAS PROUD OF I FELT A LITTLE BAD ABOUT DUPING THEM LIKE THIS 
BUT I REMEMBERED THE WORDS OF MY FATHER OBELISK KING OF THE GOLDEN 
CITY NEVER PROVIDE A NAIVE INDIVIDUAL WITH INFORMATION THAT WOULD 
LEAD TO HIS COMPETITION WITH YOU ON AN EQUAL BASIS I DECIDED TO PLAY 
A LITTLE JOKE ON MY BROTHER BLAISE I TOOK MY FORCES TO HIS SHADE AND 
SURROUNDED THE VALLEY WHERE HIS ARMY WAS CAMPED AT DAWN I ORDERED MY 
MEN DOWN INTO THE VALLEY I ALSO ADVANCED BUT KEPT MYSELF HIDDEN AS WE 
GOT CLOSE I SAW A FIGURE CLAD IN RED SILK PAJAMAS COME OUT INTO THE 
FIELD HE HELD A LANTERN AND A SWORD HE LOOKED SLEEPY WHO GOES THERE 
HE CALLED IT WAS BLAISE MY CAPTAINS ADVANCED AND BLAISE WAS QUICKLY 
SURROUNDED BY TWENTY SOLDIERS HE DROPPED THE LANTERN AND TOOK UP A 
FIGHTING STANCE BLAISE IS FOOLISH AND RASH THE JOKE COULD NOT 
CONTINUE I STEPPED OUT INTO THE IT IS I I EXCLAIMED DAMN YOU CORBIN 
WE EMBRACED AND HE SLAPPED ME ON THE BACK YOU MADE IT HE SAID WE 
WALKED TO HIS TENT THERE WE MADE PLANS TO ATTACK EMBER THIS PLANNING 
WENT ON FOR SEVERAL DAYS WE OPENED AN OLD BOTTLE OF WINE TO CELEBRATE 
OUR UPCOMING VICTORY SO WHICH OF US GETS THE THRONE AFTER WE WIN 
BLAISE ASKED WELL FLIP FOR IT I SUGGESTED HE SMILED HE WAS THINKING 
THE SAME THING I WAS AND THAT WAS THIS IF I ACTUALLY WATCHED THE COIN 
FLY THROUGH THE AIR AND REACH ITS PEAK BLAISES DAGGER WOULD FIND ITS 
WAY INTO MY BOWELS BEFORE I WOULD HAVE TIME TO CALL HEADS OR TAILS 
THAT IS THE WAY OF OUR KIND IT MAY NOT MATTER FOR ONLY ONE OF US MAY 
SURVIVE HE SAID SOMBERLY THIS IS TRUE BROTHER BUT WE ARE BOTH VALIANT 
EXUBERANT AND RASH AND THIS INCREASES OUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS GREATLY 
IT IS TRUE THAT I AM VALIANT EXUBERANT AND RASH BUT I WOULD NOT 
CHARACTERIZE YOU AS SUCH BLAISE SAID I SHOULD RATHER SAY THAT YOU ARE 
A THOUGHTFUL MAN BUT ALSO A REVENGEFUL ONE ALSO YOU ARE UNDERGOING A 
CHARACTER TRANSFORMATION DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE LONG YEARS YOU 
SPENT ON SHADE EARTH YEARS THAT HAVE SOFTENED YOU SOMEWHAT THAT IS A 
FAIR CHARACTERIZATION I SAID I JOTTED DOWN A FEW NOTES BASED ON 
BLAISES WORDS FOR I WAS PLANNING TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT ALL THIS ONE 
DAY BUT IF WE DIDNT MAKE IT TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN RIVLOK THAT 
BOOK WOULD NEVER BE WRITTEN FINALLY THE FATEFUL DAY ARRIVED COLUMNS 
OF SOLDIERS STRETCHED BACK AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE BLAISES TROOPS 
AND MINE SEEMED TO GET ALONG VERY WELL I FOUND OUT LATER THAT ALL OF 
MY TROOPS WERE MALE AND ALL OF BLAISES FEMALE WE MARCHED BLAISE AND I 
LEADING THE WAY THROUGH SHADE I WONDERED IF ERIK COULD SENSE OUR 
PRESENCE YET APPARENTLY HE COULD MONSOONS AND LIGHTNING STORMS 
ACCOSTED US AT EVERY STEP THERE WERE FORCES WORKING AGAINST US WE 
SLOGGED THROUGH HELLISH SWAMPS AND CRAWLED THROUGH INFESTED JUNGLES 
AS DENSELY MATTED AS THE HAIR OF A MONGREL DOG THE ROAD TO EMBER WAS 
TOUGH INDEED AND ERIK WASNT MAKING IT ANY EASIER WE LOST FIFTY 
THOUSAND MEN IN A SANDSTORM AND ANOTHER FIFTY THOUSAND DIED AS THEY 
WALKED OFF A CLIFF THAT WASNT ON THE MAP BLAISE AND I MAINTAINED 
CONTACT VIA THE DECK COORDINATING THE MARCH AND TALLYING THE DEATHS 
WE HAD BUT A QUARTER OF OUR TROOPS WHEN WE CROSSED THE RIVER POISEN 
THERE WE BIVOUACKED FOR TWO DAYS IN PREPARATION FOR THE FINAL MARCH 
TO RIVLOK BLAISE AND I TRADED DEEP CONCERNS WHICH WE DARED NOT SHARE 
WITH OUR OFFICERS IN THE NIGHT THE RIVER FLOODED AND MOST OF OUR 
CAMPS WERE DESTROYED I KNEW THE RIVER HAD NEVER FLOODED BEFORE SO I 
SUSPECTED ERIK HE HAD TO HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER THE ELEMENTS THE 
LIGHTNING STORMS HURRICANES FLOODS WHERE DID HE OBTAIN THIS POWER 
BLAISE AND I GATHERED UP THE THOUSAND MEN THAT REMAINED AND WE 
STARTED TOWARD THE BASE OF RIVLOK WE HAD COME TOO FAR TO GIVE UP NOW 
WE WOULD MAKE A GO OF IT BOOLEANS PATROLS BEGAN TO ATTACK BUT WE BEAT 
THEM OFF WITH MINOR LOSSES AT LAST I COULD SEE THE MOUNTAIN AND THE 
GOLDENSPIRED CITY EMBER ALONG THE EASTERN FACE OF RIVLOK FROM THE 
BASE TO THE PEAK LAY THE ESCALATOR OF EMBER ITS BASE WAS OUR 
DESTINATION FROM THERE WE WOULD BE BORNE MAGICALLY UP INTO EMBER 
ITSELF WE HAD TO MAKE IT LIGHTNING WITHOUT RAIN ASSAULTED THE TROOPS 
HUNDREDS OF MEN WERE TRANSFORMED INTO TO SMOKING SHELLS OF LIFE DAMN 
ERIKS EYES BY THE TIME WE REACHED THE ESCALATOR BLAISE AND I WERE 
ACCOMPANIED BY ONLY TWELVE OF OUR FIGHTERS WE MADE THEM GO FIRST EACH 
ONE IN TURN STEPPED ONTO THE MOVING STAIRWAY AND AS THEY WERE CARRIED 
UPWARD THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS FOR WE COULD SEE ERIKS MEN COMING DOWN 
TOWARD US WE WOULD MEET HALFWAY UP THE MOUNTAIN I TOO LOOSENED MY 
BLADE WHICH I HAD NAMED GRACELAND YEARS BEFORE WHEN I HAD FORGED IT 
OUT OF SHADE BLAISE LIFTED HIS OWN FINELY INLAID SWORD I GRASPED THE 
HAND RAILING FOR SAFETY AT LAST THOSE OF US GOING UP THE UP ESCALATOR 
MET THOSE COMING DOWN THE DOWN ESCALATOR AND MUCH BLOOD WAS SPILLED 
OUR VANGUARD SLASHED AT ERIKS TROOPERS AND BLAISE AND I FINISHED THEM 
OFF AS THEY CAME DOWN TO US IN THREE HOURS WE WOULD BE AT THE TOP BUT 
THINGS DID NOT GO WELL ERIKS MEN SCORED SEVERAL HITS AND OUR FIGHTERS 
WERE KNOCKED OFF THE ESCALATOR SOON IT WAS DOWN TO ME AND BLAISE 
ALONE BUT WE WORKED WITH PRECISION MY FRIEND THEY FELL AND FELL AND I 
COULD SEE THE FEAR IN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO HAD NOT YET REACHED US 
FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY TOO WOULD DIE I LOOKED DOWN BEHIND ME AND I 
SAW THE DEAD BODIES BEING CARRIED AWAY AT THE BOTTOM OF RIVLOK THE 
PILE OF ERIKS SOLDIERS WAS GROWING LARGER EVEN AS BLAISE WAS 
BEGINNING TO TIRE FRESH SOLDIERS BEGAN APPEARING ON THE DOWN 
ESCALATOR ONE OF THEM MANAGED TO HIT BLAISE ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD 
BEFORE I TOOK HIM OUT WITH A THROWN DAGGER BUT BLAISE WAS REELING 
BACKWARD NOW HOLD ON TO THE HAND RAIL I YELLED BUT IT WAS TOO LATE 
BLAISE FELL BACKWARD AND OVER THE EDGE I SAW HIS DEATH COMING AND I 
HAD TO STOP IT I HURLED MY DECK TO HIM AND HE GRABBED FOR IT I DONT 
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED NEXT BECAUSE SOMEONE BROUGHT A SWORD CRASHING DOWN 
ON MY LEFT SHOULDER I WHEELED AND LUNGED KILLING TWO WITH A SINGLE 
THRUST I SMASHED THE HILT OF MY SWORD INTO THE NEXT MANS HEAD AND 
LEFT A DAGGER IN THE THROAT OF THE NEXT I KICKED THE NEXT ONE OVER 
THE SIDE MY FIST CONNECTED WITH THE FACE OF MY NEXT VICTIM WHO FELL 
BACK ONTO THE MAN BEHIND HIM I KILLED THEM BOTH WITH A SLICE OF MY 
BLADE I REMOVED MY BOOT AND HURLED IT AT THE MAN BEHIND THEM THE BOOT 
STRUCK THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD DISORIENTING HIM GIVING ME ENOUGH TIME TO 
DELIVER A DEATH BLOW THE NEXT MAN I STRANGLED WITH THE SHOELACE FROM 
MY REMAINING BOOT AND THEN ANOTHER FELL BENEATH THE HEAVY BELT BUCKLE 
I SWUNG AT HIM THEY DIED AND DIED LIKE THAT FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS I 
POISONED THEM I HUNG THEM I IMPALED THEM WITH EACH OF THE NINE 
BALLISTIC WEAPONS I CARRIED ON MY BACK AND STILL THEM CAME ERIK 
SEEMED TO POSSESS AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF WARRIORS BUT I COULD SEE THE 
TOP JUST THEN I FELL FORWARD THE ESCALATOR HAD STOPPED AND WAS NOW 
REVERSING ITSELF I SCAMPERED UPWARDS BUT COULD MAKE NO PROGRESS I WAS 
NOW CONVINCED THAT ERIK HAD POWERS FAR BEYOND THE ORDINARY THE 
ESCALATOR HAD NEVER REVERSED DIRECTION BEFORE BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A 
WAY I JUMPED OVER THE GUARD RAILING TO THE DOWN ESCALATOR WHICH WAS 
NOW GOING UP ERIKS SOLDIERS WERE ALSO GOING UP BUT WHEN THEY SAW ME 
JUMP THEY STARTED WALKING TOWARD ME AFTER A FEW MINUTES THE 
ESCALATORS SWITCHED DIRECTIONS AGAIN AND I JUMPED AGAIN I WOULD MAKE 
IT TO THE TOP NO MATTER HOW OFTEN ERIK TRIED TO STOP ME AND MAKE IT 
TO THE TOP I DID I ALMOST WISHED I HAD NOT AT LEAST FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
OF EMBERS FINEST WARRIORS STOOD TO MEET ME AT THE PALACE GATE I 
STEELED MY NERVE AND RAISED MY SWORD THIS WASNT GOING TO BE EASY LET 
ME BE BRIEF I LOST I SAT IN THE DARKNESS OF MY CELL THE SMELL OF DEAD 
ANIMALS WAFTED BACK AND FORTH OVER THE MILDEWING POOLS IN WHICH FEET 
SOAKED THE PLACE REMINDED ME OF THE SQUALID SHADE WHERE ERIK HAD LEFT 
ME TO DIE ALL THOSE YEARS AGO OF COURSE I HAD GROWN TO LOVE THAT 
PLACE AND SO ANY REMINDER OF IT MADE ME FEEL AT HOME WHY HAD I COME 
TO EMBER ANYWAY ALL THE TRIP HAD GOTTEN ME WAS A FEW BUMPS ON THE 
HEAD AND A LIFE SENTENCE TO THE DEEP DARK DUNGEONS I SEARCHED THE 
ROOM FOR IMPLEMENTS OF SUICIDE BUT FOUND NONE WE EMBERITES WOULD 
RATHER DIE THAN ACCEPT LIFE IN PRISON THIS IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE 
LIVE FOR A VERY LONG LONG TIME I SIGHED I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE STAYED 
HOME AFTER THREE DAYS MEN CAME TO GET ME I WONDERED WHERE THEY WOULD 
TAKE ME TO THE TORTURE CHAMBERS TO BE DRAWN AND QUARTERED TO HAVE MY 
EYES BURNED FROM MY HEAD WITH HOT COALS NO MY FRIEND NONE OF THESE 
THEY DRAGGED ME INSTEAD TO THE FAMOUS FASHION DISTRICT OF EMBER AT 
FIRST I WAS PLEASED BUT THEN I GREW SUSPICIOUS WHY WOULD ERIK HAVE ME 
TAKEN HERE A CHANGE OF HEART PERHAPS OF HAD HE BEEN DEPOSED ALREADY 
BY A FRIENDLY POWER I SHOWERED AND THEN I WAS TAKEN TO THE BARBER 
WHERE I WAS BLINDFOLDED AND STRAPPED INTO A CHAIR WHILE MY GUARDSMEN 
TAUNTED ME THE BARBER WENT TO WORK AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE 
REMOVED THE BLINDFOLD WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO MY HAIR I YELLED 
THE BARBER GRINNED AND THEN I NOTICED HE WORE BLACK AND RED WHICH 
WERE ERIKS COLORS UNDER HEAVY GUARD I WAS PUSHED AROUND THE DISTRICT 
WE STOPPED TO BUY CLOTHES SEVERAL TIMES AGAIN I COULD DO NOTHING THEY 
PURCHASED FOR ME A PAIR OF PRERENAISSANCE LEGGINGS A DRACULA CAPE AND 
BOOTS LIKE THE ONES MY FATHER HAD WORN WHEN HE WAS YOUNG THEY FORCED 
ME TO WEAR THE THINGS I WAS AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OUT OF 
FASHION A VOICE INSIDE MY HEAD KEPT REMINDING ME THAT ERIK WAS BEHIND 
IT ALL IT WAS NOT UNTIL I SAW A SIGN ON THE STREET THAT I FINALLY 
UNDERSTOOD THE SIGN SAID CORONATION WEDNESDAY DRESS ACCORDINGLY I WAS

MODE OF TRANSPORTATION WALKING IN SHADE MY NAME LORD CORBIN FIRST 
STOP REVLON AH FAIR REVLON A SHADE WORLD I ONCE KNEW SO WELL I HAD 
RULED THERE FOR MANY YEARS IN THE OLD TIMES REVLON WAS MY HOME AWAY 
FROM EMBER AND THROUGH MY PRESENCE THERE I HAD BUILT IT INTO A MIGHTY 
POWER ROLLING HILLS DEEP FORESTS MEN OF HONOR FAIR MAIDENS FAIR 
MAIDENS WITH HEAVY MAKEUP STRANGE AS IT MAY SOUND THE MAKEUP OF 
REVLON WOULD ENABLE ME TO LAUNCH A MASSIVE ATTACK ON EMBER AND WIN 
BACK WHAT WAS RIGHTFULLY MINE YEARS BEFORE YOU SEE I HAD BROUGHT A 
CASE OF REVLON ROUGE TO EMBER AS A GIFT FOR MY SISTER DIDI SHE DIDNT 
LIKE THE STUFF AND IN MY ANGER I THREW IT INTO THE FIREPLACE IT 
EXPLODED VERY PRETTILY AND VERY NOISILY MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS I WAS 
LUCKY THAT DIDI HAD SPURNED THE GIFT FOR SHE SOMETIMES SMOKES MY 
SECOND THOUGHT WAS WAIT A MINUTE NOTHING EXPLODES IN EMBER AND SO I 
FORMULATED A PLAN TO BUILD WEAPONS BASED ON THIS CHEMICAL WEAPONS 
WHICH WOULD ONE DAY MAKE ME THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN EMBER 
UNFORTUNATELY THIS PLAN HAD SLIPPED MY MIND LAST TIME AROUND BLAISE 
FELL OFF A CLIFF AND I GOT FOUR YEARS IN THE SLAMMER BECAUSE OF IT 
NOT THIS TIME BROTHER I SHIFTED SHADE FOR REVLON I CAME UPON SEVEN 
MEN SIX DEAD AND ONE SLOUCHED AGAINST A THICK OAK I HATED TO SEE SO 
MANY DEAD MEN SO USING MY POWER AS PRINCE OF THE BLOOD I WALKED TO A 
NEARBY SHADE WHERE THERE WERE ALSO SEVEN MEN BUT ONLY ONE WAS DEAD 
THE OTHER SIX STOOD LAUGHING THEY NOTICED ME AS I APPROACHED WOTS 
THIS THEN SAID ONE THEIR SHIRTS WERE THIN AND RAGGED PROBABLY FROM 
THE BATTLE THAT HAD RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF THE ONE WHO LAY 
PLASTERED ON THE GROUND WARRIORS I SAID DOES ANY OF YOUR NUMBER KNOW 
THE WAY TO REVLON THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER QUIZZICALLY FOR WHOM DO 
YOU FIGHT I ASKED THEY TRIED WHO IS YOUR LEADER THA WOULD BE ME BLOKE 
SAID ONE OF THE TALL ONES YOU INNERESTED IN JOININ US HEADIN FOR 
REVLON WE ARE FINE FINE I SAID WHAT INSTRUMENT DO YOU PLAY HE ASKED I 
PLAY SOME GUITAR BUT WHY DO YOU ASK WERE A HEAVY METAL BAND BOY AND 
LORD KNOWS WE NEED ANOTHER GUITARIST WE ONLY GOT THREE PIPED ONE OF 
THE SHORT ONES YOURE IN SAID THE LEADER AND HE SLAPPED ME ON THE BACK 
I WASNT REALLY INTERESTED IN HANGING AROUND WITH A BURNED OUT METAL 
BAND BUT I HAD TO ADMIT I WAS OUT OF PRACTICE AND A FEW JAM SESSIONS 
WOULD BE JUST THE THING TO GET ME BACK INTO TOP FORM I WOULD TRAVEL 
WITH THESE MEN TO REVLON IVE BEEN IN THE SLAMMER I EXPLAINED THEY 
MURMURED TO EACH OTHER IN THEIR HEAVY FOREIGN ACCENTS I COULD ONLY 
PICK OUT THE WORDS PIGS AND DRUGS I SLEPT AND IN THE MORNING I FOUND 
THAT MY SWORD GRACELAND HAD TRANSMUTED ITSELF INTO A SILVER 
STRATOCASTER I PICKED IT UP AND PLAYED A C CHORD THEN A G THE GUITAR 
WAS IN TUNE I CRADLED THE NECK AND PULLED UP ON THE DISTORTION BAR 
YES I KNEW HOW TO USE THE THING OUTSIDE THE MEN IN THE BAND WERE 
TUNING THEIR INSTRUMENTS THE TWO DRUMMERS WERE DUELING THE 
BASSISTVOCALIST WAS RUNNING THROUGH SOME SCALES I STEPPED OUT AND 
ROARED INTO A STONES RIFF THE OTHER GUITARISTS WERE TAKEN ABACK THEY 
JUMPED IN WITH SOME RHYTHM AND ONE OF THEM CONTESTED ME FOR THE LEAD 
I WAS ABLE TO SQUEEZE IN MORE NOTES PER SECOND HOWEVER AND HE QUICKLY 
CONCEDED I SWITCHED TO SOME OF THE HEAVIER STUFF AFTER AN HOUR TWO OF 
THE GUITARISTS PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND HAD A SMOKE THE OTHER ONE 
PLAYED WITH ME FOR ANOTHER HOUR BUT HE TOO GREW TIRED I WAS JUST 
STARTING TO FEEL BACK IN SHAPE THOUGH AND I WANTED TO PUSH MYSELF I 
PLAYED A FEW SONGS WITH THE DRUMMERS THEN ENGAGED THE BASSISTVOCALIST 
IN AN EXTENDED VERSION OF STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN THAT NIGHT I ATE A HUGE 
MEAL AND SLEPT FOR TEN HOURS I REPEATED THE SAME ROUTINE FOR THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS AS WE DREW CLOSER TO REVLON ON THE FOURTH NIGHT I MET LAUREN 
I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT WE MET AN A PATIO OVERLOOKING A LAKE 
WITH THE FULL MOON HIGHLIGHTING HER HAIR AND HER SILVERY DRESS BUT 
THAT WOULD BE CRAP I HAD SEEN HER SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE FIRST WITH THE 
BASSISTVOCALIST THEN WITH ONE OF THE GUITARISTS AND LATER WITH THE 
TWO DRUMMERS THE FIRST TIME I EVER SPOKE WITH HER THOUGH WAS AFTER A 
GIG SHE CAME BY MY DRESSING ROOM AND ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO DO IT I 
SAID YEAH SURE SHE SAID SHE LOVED ME I SAID CRAP BUT SHE STARTED 
HANGING AROUND ME ANYWAY WE SPENT SEVERAL NIGHTS TOGETHER AND SHE 
TOLD ME MANY THINGS IVE SEEN YOU PLAY YOURE GOOD SHE SAID IVE SEEN 
BETTER I REPLIED THE GUYS IN THE BAND RESPECT YOU THEY ALSO FEAR YOU 
WHY BECAUSE I CAN SQUEEZE A FEW MORE NOTES OUT OF MY STRAT THEY THINK 
THERE IS SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL INVOLVED THEYRE DEVIL WORSHIPPERS YOU 
KNOW I HAD NOT KNOWN THIS BUT AS I REFLECTED UPON THE HUMAN SKELETONS 
THE PYROTECHNICS AND THE HELLINSPIRED LYRICS THAT MADE UP OUR SHOW 
PIECES OF THE PUZZLE BEGAN TO FALL TOGETHER PERHAPS IT WAS NO 
ACCIDENT THAT I A MAN WHO HAD BEEN CALLED A DEMON MORE THAN ONCE 
SHOULD FALL IN WITH SUCH A CROWD I LAUGHED ALOUD TO HIDE MY THOUGHTS 
IM NO DEMON I SAID IM JUST THE SECOND BEST GUITARIST AROUND THATS ALL 
WHOS THE BEST BENEDICTUS OF EMBER IF HE IS STILL ALIVE I REPLIED 
BENEDICTUS HAD ONCE UPSTAGED THE MOONPEOPLE OF GHINESH BY DOING FOUR 
ENCORES IN A SINGLE NIGHT WE ARE A VERY MUSICAL FAMILY WANNA DO IT 
SHE ASKED YEAH SURE I REPLIED I LOVE YOU THERE WAS SOMETHING SAD 
ABOUT LAUREN THOUGH I ENJOYED MY TIME WITH HER AND VICEVERSA ONE 
NIGHT SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS GOING TO DIE I ASKED HER WHY SHE SAID 
THAT SOON THE BAND WOULD BREAK UP AND WITHOUT US SHE WAS NOTHING I 
WAS SILENT FOR I KNEW THAT THE BAND WOULD INDEED BREAK UP I WOULD BE 
THE FIRST TO LEAVE ONCE WE REACHED REVLON I HAD NO CHOICE MY DESTINY 
WAS TO BECOME KING OF EMBER NOT BANDLEADER OF DEVILPEOPLE WITH A FEW 
GIGS UNDER MY BELT I FELT BETTER THAN EVER I NO LONGER FELT THE 
PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STRAINS OF MY FOUR YEARS IN THE BIG LAUREN 
LAY NEXT TO ME SLEEPING SUDDENLY HER EYES GREW WIDE YOU ARE IN 
TROUBLE SHE SAID FLATLY BEFORE I COULD FORMULATE AN ANSWER THE DOOR

PROMISE I PROMISED THE NAME IS GALENON AND IF I MAY OFFER YOU SOME 
PATERNAL ADVICE I WOULD TRANSMUTE THAT GUITAR BACK INTO A SWORD THE 
TIMES THEY ARE ACHANGIN I CHUCKLED AND SNORTED AND DID THIS THING AND 
WE STAYED UP MOST OF THE NIGHT TALKED OF OUR RESPECTIVE TRAVELS 
GALENON WAS ALSO ON THE ROAD TO REVLON AS IT TURNED OUT AND I DECIDED 
TO SPLIT THE BAND AND JOIN HIM I PACKED MY THINGS AND LEFT IN THE 
NIGHT I WAS FORTHRIGHT WITH GALENON FOR I TRUSTED HIM I TOLD HIM OF 
EMBER AND OF MY PLANS TO TAKE THE THRONE HE HAD HEARD OF EMBER AND 
ASKED TO BE MY LIEUTENANT IN THE UPCOMING BATTLE I ACCEPTED HIS OFFER 
WE REACHED REVLON AT LAST I WONDERED IF ITS INHABITANTS WOULD STILL 
REMEMBER ME THEIR RULER OF FIVE HUNDRED YEARS PAST AT THE BORDER A 
GUARD STOPPED US YOU LOOK FAMILIAR HE TOLD ME YOU LOOK JUST LIKE THAT 
GUY ON THE OLD COINS GEORGE WASHINGTON I TRIED NO NO THAT OTHER GUY 
LINCOLN KENNEDY HES ON THE HALFDOLLAR I SUGGESTED FORGET IT YOU MAY 
PASS WAS IT JEFFERSON THOMAS JEFFERSON GALENON NUDGED ME I DONT MEAN 
TO SOUND LIKE YOUR FATHER HE SAID BUT DONT YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO BE 
GETTING THE EXPLOSIVE ROUGE RIGHT I SAID WE MADE IT TO THE CITY WHERE 
WE WERE APPROACHED BY THE LOCAL COPS THEY INSISTED THAT WE SEE A MAN 
KNOWN AS THE DEFENDER IN CITY HALL WE TRAVELLED TO THIS PLACE INSIDE 
I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THE MAN BEHIND THE DESK WAS MY OWN 
BROTHER BENEDICTUS OF EMBER MY EYES WIDENED AND SO DID HIS BROTHER 
SAID HE BROTHER REPLIED I HOW FARE THEE HE ASKED I DARED NOT TELL HIM 
OF MY PLANS FINE AND YOU I SAID I AM TIRED AND AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE 
NO ARMS THIS WAS TRUE HE HAD NO ARMS THIS IS TRUE YOU HAVE NO ARMS 
HOW DID THIS THING COME ABOUT IT IS A LONG STORY BUT AT LAST I HAVE 
REUNITED REVLON AND DRIVEN THE DEMON CREATURES OUT DEMON CREATURES 
DEMONS OF EMBER NO DEMONS OF REVLON A PARTICULARLY NASTY RACE OF 
BEINGS KNOWN AS HOUSEMAIDS COLD ICY STUBBORN BEASTS THEY REFUSE TO DO 
WINDOWS AND WORSE THEY ALWAYS PUT STUFF BACK IN THE WRONG DRAWERS 
THEIR ATTACKS BEGAN THREE YEARS AGO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THEY CAUSED 
GREAT CONFUSION IN THE LAND IN AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT I 
MET WITH THEIR LEADER A WOMAN CALLED LINDA UNFORTUNATELY I WAS FORCED 
TO KILL HER AFTER SHE LOPPED OFF MY ARMS MUCH LATER I MADE LOVE TO 
HER AND THEN BEGAN COUNTERATTACKING HER TROOPS ONLY IN THE PAST MONTH 
HAVE WE DRIVEN THEM FROM THE CITY I WILL CONTINUE THE PATROLS FOR THE 
NEXT TWO HUNDRED YEARS HOWEVER FOR WE MAY HAVE MISSED ONE OR TWO OF 
THEM PRUDENT SAID I BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME I HEAR YOU ESCAPED ERIKS 
DUNGEONS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS TUNNELS I SAID HE 
RAISED HIS EYEBROWS HE KNEW I WAS LYING BUT HE DARED NOT ACCUSE ME 
HAD HE ACCUSED ME THOUGH I WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CHALLENGE HIM TO 
A DUEL OF THE BLADES AND THIS WAS A THING I DID NOT WANT TO DO FOR 
EVEN WITHOUT ARMS HE COULD STILL OUTFENCE ANY OF US I FEARED HIM 
PROPERLY YOU ARE FREE TO STAY IN MY HOUSE CORBIN OF COURSE BUT IF YOU 
ARE PLANNING TO USE REVLON AS A STAGING AREA FOR AN ATTACK ON EMBER 
THEN YOU HAVE COME AT THE WRONG TIME I WILL NOT PERMIT SUCH A THING 
NO PROBLEM I SAID I APPRECIATE YOUR HOSPITALITY BENEDICTUS LIVE LONG 
AND PROSPER I WANTED TO ASK HIM MORE ABOUT REVLON AND ABOUT THE 
HOUSEMAIDS AND THEIR LEADER LINDA WHOM HE SLEW AND LATER LOVED BUT 
THERE WAS NO TIME I SENT GALENON TO SEARCH FOR THE EXPLOSIVE ROUGE 
FOR MY OWN PART I BEGAN TO MENTALLY ORGANIZE THE WEAPONRY AND 
PERSONNEL I WOULD REQUIRE AS I WALKED THROUGH THE FOREST I DECIDED 
WHERE AND HOW I WOULD GATHER THE NECESSARY MATERIEL FOR MY WAR 
AGAINST ERIK SUDDENLY A WOMAN APPEARED SHE WAS THIN AND FRECKLED AND 
SHE HELD A THIN AND FRECKLED BLADE IN HER RIGHT HAND WANNA DO IT SHE 
ASKED NOT AGAIN I THOUGHT LETS FENCE FIRST I SAID HER BLADE ROSE SHE

MY OLD HOME TO WIT THE GROUND WAS LITTERED WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS WE 
COLLECTED THESE WEAPONS AND TOOK THEM TO A MORE FAMILIAR SHADE THE 
PLACE WHERE I HAD COLLECTED MY ARMY SO MANY YEARS BEFORE YOU MIGHT 
THINK THAT THE INHABITANTS WOULD BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR I HAD TAKEN 
THEIR YOUTH FROM THEM AND CAUSED THEM TO DIE USELESSLY IN A FOREIGN 
WAR BUT THESE PEOPLE REVERED ME AS A GOD AND THOUSANDS OF THEM WOULD 
VOLUNTEER AGAIN I HAD ONLY TO ASK GALENON AND I ARRIVED A MULTITUDE

MADE SOME FINAL ARRANGEMENTS AND THEN WE SET OFF FOR EMBER BY NOW I 
HAD MASTERED THE AXIOMS OF EMBER I KNEW THAT ALL ROADS LEAD TO EMBER 
FOR INSTANCE SO I PICKED A ROAD AND FOLLOWED IT AND MY MEN FOLLOWED

SMALL SIZE OF OUR FORCE CORBIN GALENON SAID YES I ANSWERED OFTEN YOU

MYSELF KNOW NOTHING OF SUCH BEINGS HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY AWAIT ITS ON 
THE COVER OF THE PAPERBACK I REPLIED WHAT PAPERBACK THE GUNS OF

ARE NOTORIOUSLY UNRELATED TO THE THE TEXT THAT LAY BETWEEN THE PAGES 
I WOULD WAGER THAT THERE ARE NO DEMONS OF EMBER HE WAGERED HMM YOU 
MAY HAVE A POINT BUT IF YOU ARE RIGHT THEN IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT 
THE GUNS OF REVLON IS NEITHER A HUGO NOR A NEBULA AWARD WINNER GOOD

A MICHAEL MOORCOCK BOOK GET HOLD OF YOURSELF SON SAID GALENON MAYBE

POURING IN ACROSS A HUGE EXPANSE OF DARKNESS SOME KIND OF BLACK ROAD 
THAT LED FROM DEEP INSIDE SHADE RIGHT UP TO THE FOOT OF RIVLOK I HAD 
PLANNED TO TAKE EMBER BY KILLING ERIK BUT NOW IN ONE OF THOSE 
SPLITSECOND DECISIONS YOU USUALLY WIND UP REGRETTING I ORDERED MY MEN 
TO ATTACK THE SHADE BEASTS RATHER THAN ERIKS MEN CONFUSED THEY 
CARRIED OUT THEIR ORDERS O HOW THEY DIED THAT DAY THE CREATURES 
BURNED AND DIED AND HEAVED AND I CHUCKLED I DIVERTED MY ATTENTION 
FROM THE BATTLE IN ORDER TO FIND MY BROTHER ERIK AT LAST I SPOTTED 
HIM ON THE FAR MOUNTAINSIDE I LEFT GALENON IN CHARGE OF THE BATTLE 
AFTER NEGOTIATING THE CRAGS AND CREVICES I REACHED ERIK HE WAS LYING 
ON HIS BACK BLEEDING AROUND HIS NECK WAS THE JEWEL OF THE JUDGE A 
MAGICAL PENDANT OFTEN WORN BY OUR FATHER I AM DYING HE ANNOUNCED OH 
YEAH I STUTTERED THATS UH TOO BAD ERIK LISTEN ABOUT YOUR DEATH CURSE 
I MEAN YOURE NOT GOING TO I MEAN WELL YOU DONT EVEN HAVE TO HAVE A 
DEATH CURSE NOT IF YOU DONT WANT TO ITS NOT LIKE A LAW OR ANYTHING 
EVEN IF IT WAS WHAT COULD THEY DO TO YOU I MEAN YOURE DEAD AND IF YOU 
DIDNT USE YOUR DEATH CURSE TOO BAD ENOUGH HE SPUTTERED SPITTING BLOOD 
ALL OVER ME JESUS CHRIST THATS DISGUSTING I OBSERVED I RESERVE MY 
DEATH CURSE FOR THE CREATURES FROM THE BLACK FREEWAY AND I GIVE YOU 
THIS JEWEL WITH IT YOU CAN CONTROL THE WEATHER YOU MUST ATTUNE 
YOURSELF TO IT BY WEARING IT AND WALKING THE DESIGN YOURE IN COMMAND 
NOW HE COUGHED UP A LUNG YOULL FIND THAT THINGS ARE NOT WHAT YOU 
EXPECTED EMBER IS IN DEEP TROUBLE DEEP HE GASPED FOR AIR CAN I GET 
YOU SOME WATER OR SOMETHING I ASKED HE MUMBLED HIS DEATH CURSE A 
HORRIBLE THING TO HEAR IT HAD AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON THE BATTLE THE 
CREATURES BEGAN RETREATING ERIK HEAVED HIS LAST BREATH THEN I TOOK 
THE JEWEL FROM ABOUT HIS NECK IT PULSED CURIOUSLY IN MY HANDS HE HAD 
SAID TO TAKE IT TO THE DESIGN I SIGNALLED GALENON TO PURSUE THE 
CREATURES I HEADED FOR THE CASTLE MYSELF JUST INSIDE I RAN INTO RANDY 
CORBIN HE SAID DOWNSTAIRS SOMETHINGS HAPPENING WE BOTH RAN DOWN TO 
THE DESIGN ROOM SOMEONE WAS WALKING THE DESIGN ALREADY WHO WAS IT I 
SQUINTED BUT COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE FACE SOME CHICK SAID RANDY NEVER 
SEEN HER I LOOKED AGAIN IT WAS DARLA WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS RANDY 
ASKED IT PORTENDS TREASON TREACHERY AND OBLIVION I SAID WHAT DOES

TURNED TO THE GIRL AND YELLED DARLA WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING SHE
